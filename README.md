# ðŸ›’ Store Sales Forecasting ðŸ“ˆ

- In this project, we will predict **store sales** of **CorporaciÃ³n Favorita**, a leading grocery retailer based in Ecuador. We will harness the power of **machine learning** combined with insightful **data visualization** and **feature engineering** to uncover patterns and make accurate sales forecasts. 

### ðŸ“Š Key Highlights:
- **Random Forest Regressor**: We'll develop a powerful model for sales prediction.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhance model performance by adding meaningful features from the dataset.
- **Sampling**: Optimize computation by working with subsets of the large dataset (~3M rows). âš¡
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Decode seasonality and trends to predict store sales effectively. ðŸ•’

Our data comes from the [Kaggle Store Sales Time Series Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting), offering rich information like store types, promotions, holidays, oil prices, and more.
